Fault analysis and selection of circuit breaker ratings in a power system


Power systems are meant to be continuously functioning systems to sustain human life and therefore they need be protected against abnormal conditions such as short circuit faults and overloads. In case of a fault, circuit breakers must immediately cut off the current, which is very likely to be extremely high. In a power system, the selection of circuit breaker ratings must be done in accordance with the possible faults in order to protect the system against any damage and to ensure stability.  To assess the maximum ratings of the circuit breakers, a detailed fault analysis of the power system needs to be done.


**The aim of this project is to review the issue of fault analysis in order to select appropriate ratings for the circuit breakers and to contribute to the issue.**
